## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

#### Tailwind CSS

- I discovered how to use Tailwind for styling, since I already have a solid understanding of CSS, it was easier to get started.

- The main difficulty I faced was responsive design. As a beginner, it felt a bit tricky, but I learned a lot about handling breakpoints.

- One drawback I noticed: with long class lists, the code can become less readable compared to traditional CSS.

#### JavaScript

This is my second project using JavaScript:

- I learned how to get values from a form using ``.value``.

- I practiced changing styles dynamically from JS and it's easy more with Tailwind.

- I got familiar with useful functions and methods such as: `classList.replace()` , `checkValidity()` , `form.reset()` ...etc; 

- I learned many `EventListener` such as: `Click`, `Submit`, `Input` ...etc.

- `preventDefault()` prevents the default behavior of an event (for example, automatically reloading the page when submitting a form), allowing full control through JavaScript logic.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://chatgpt.com/) - This helped me understand how different CSS properties work together, especially layout behavior and default styles. I used it as a coding assistant whenever I had a doubt.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The official documentation was a great resource for me while working on this project. I really liked how well-structured it is, with clear examples for each utility class. It helped me understand how to quickly apply styles and manage responsive design using Tailwind.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I used this site a lot to review syntax, explore new CSS properties, and test small snippets of code. It's really helpful for quick references and hands-on practice while learning.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - I used this documentation frequently to understand JavaScript methods, DOM events, and browser APIs. Itâ€™s an excellent resource for clear explanations and reliable references.
